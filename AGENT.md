# Vibe Tracker

This is a simple location tracker website built with Go/PocketBase for the backend and
Leaflet.js for the frontend.

## Generic rules

- Always **PLAN** first, and only start coding when I approved the plan.

## Build & Commands

- Run dev server: `go run . serve`

### Development Environment

- Admin: http://localhost:8090/_/
- Client: http://localhost:8090/

## Code Style

- Go: code is formatted with `go fmt`
  - Use `go fmt` to format the code before committing.
  - Indent go code with tabs.
- Indent HTML, JavaScript and CSS code with 2 spaces.
- Try to use max. 100 characters per line.
- I'm an old school guy, so use semi-colons in JavaScript.
