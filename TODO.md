- waypoints:
  - photo support
  - move them to the session endpoint
  - change display similar to start/stop markers

- session data is missing from overview
- I seem to be logged out on page reloads sometimes

- better (location tracking) session management
  - landmarks (waypoints) setup
  - multi-user sessions
    - refactor route display to support multiple users

- frontend improvements
  - "UI framework", e.g. generic classes for buttons, inputs, etc.
  - session management UI refactor
