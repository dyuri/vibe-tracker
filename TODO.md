- frontend improvements
  - waypoint / marker styles are inconsistent
  - "UI framework", e.g. generic classes for buttons, inputs, etc.
    - waypoint editor fix - input fields are too wide

- better (location tracking) session management
  - multi-user sessions
    - refactor route display to support multiple users
