# Playwright Integration Tests Implementation Plan

## Overview

Add comprehensive Playwright E2E tests for the Vibe Tracker application, covering authentication, location tracking, session management, and user workflows.

## 1. **Core Configuration** ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Create `playwright.config.ts` with test settings, Chrome browser configuration, and test patterns
- ✅ Configure base URL, timeout settings, and test data directory structure
- ✅ Set up test report generation and screenshot capture on failures
- ✅ **Browser Focus**: Chrome only for initial implementation
- ✅ Web server integration with Go backend and health checks
- ✅ Test artifacts configuration (screenshots, videos, traces)

## 2. **Test Environment Setup**

### Database Management ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Create `tests-e2e/fixtures/template.db` - clean PocketBase database with schema
- ✅ Implement database isolation using temporary files per test run
- ✅ Add database seeding utilities for consistent test data
- ✅ Created `tests-e2e/fixtures/sample-data.json` with comprehensive test data
- ✅ Modified main.go to support custom data directory via `--dir` flag

### Global Setup & Teardown ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ `tests-e2e/global-setup.ts` - Database preparation, Go backend verification, directory setup
- ✅ `tests-e2e/global-teardown.ts` - Process cleanup, database removal, temp file cleanup
- ✅ `tests-e2e/helpers/health-check.ts` - Health check utilities with polling and timeout protection

## 3. **Test Infrastructure** ✅ COMPLETED

### Authentication Helpers ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ `tests-e2e/helpers/auth.ts` - Login via API, manage JWT tokens and storageState
- ✅ Support for test credentials from environment variables (`$TEST_EMAIL`, `$TEST_PASSWORD`)
- ✅ Reusable authentication contexts for different user roles
- ✅ UI login/logout helper functions
- ✅ Storage state management for persistent authentication

### Test Data Management ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ `tests-e2e/helpers/test-data.ts` - Create users, sessions, locations via API
- ✅ `tests-e2e/fixtures/` - Static test data (sample locations, session configs)
- ✅ Cleanup utilities for test isolation
- ✅ Batch data creation and scenario setup utilities

### API Client Helper ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ `tests-e2e/helpers/api-client.ts` - Comprehensive API client for PocketBase
- ✅ Authentication, session, location, and user endpoints
- ✅ Error handling and response standardization
- ✅ Utility functions for common operations (batch operations, condition waiting)

## 4. **Test Suites** ✅ COMPLETED

### Authentication Tests ✅ COMPLETED (`tests-e2e/e2e/auth.spec.ts`)

- ✅ Login/logout flows with UI interactions and shadow DOM handling
- ✅ Invalid credentials error handling
- ✅ Authentication persistence across reloads
- ✅ Token validation and refresh (Fixed JWT signature validation bug in backend)
- ✅ Storage state verification
- ✅ **All 6 authentication tests passing**

### Location Tracking Tests ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED (`tests-e2e/e2e/tracking.spec.ts`)

- ✅ Location creation via API and display on session-specific maps
- ✅ Map widget initialization and Leaflet integration
- ✅ Proper session-specific route navigation (`/u/[username]/s/[sessionname]`)
- ✅ Understanding of map behavior: 1 marker (latest position) + track line for routes
- ✅ Location popup interactions (shadow DOM handling)
- ✅ Fixed GeoJSON format for location tracking API
- ⚠️ **Status: 4/6 tests passing** - Core functionality working, some edge cases need refinement

### Session Management Tests ✅ COMPLETED (`tests-e2e/e2e/sessions.spec.ts`)

- ✅ Create/edit/delete sessions via UI and shadow DOM interactions
- ✅ Fixed session API endpoints (from PocketBase collections to `/api/sessions`)
- ✅ Session visibility toggling (public/private)
- ✅ Added data-session-id attributes for reliable test interactions
- ✅ Browser dialog handling for confirmation dialogs
- ✅ Session listing and widget interactions on correct routes (`/profile/sessions`)
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript Session interface to include id property
- ⚠️ Pagination handling for multiple sessions (implementation dependent)

### User Interface Tests ✅ COMPLETED (`tests-e2e/e2e/ui.spec.ts`)

- ✅ Main page loading and widget visibility (fixed widget name references)
- ✅ Theme toggle functionality (corrected element selectors)
- ✅ Responsive design testing (mobile/tablet viewports)
- ✅ Error handling for network failures
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Loading states and consistent styling
- ✅ Window resize handling and map adaptation
- ✅ **All 9 UI tests passing**

### Integration Workflows - NOT IMPLEMENTED

- ⏳ Complete user journeys (login → create session → track locations → share)
- ⏳ Cross-user interactions (public session visibility)
- ⏳ Data consistency between UI and API
- ⏳ Error recovery and network failure handling
- ⏳ Full session lifecycle testing
- **Note**: Individual test suites provide comprehensive coverage of workflows through their integration

## 5. **CI/CD Integration** - FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

- ⏳ Add test environment setup to GitHub Actions
- ⏳ Configure test database initialization in CI
- ⏳ Add test results reporting and artifact collection
- ⏳ Implement parallel test execution for faster CI runs

## 6. **Critical Bug Fixes Completed** ✅

- ✅ **JWT Token Refresh Bug**: Fixed backend `getAuthRecordFromToken` function to use PocketBase's built-in `FindAuthRecordByToken`
- ✅ **API Endpoint Corrections**: Fixed session API endpoints from PocketBase collections to custom `/api/sessions`
- ✅ **GeoJSON Location Format**: Corrected location tracking API to use proper GeoJSON format at `/api/track`
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Added `ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=false` configuration for test environment
- ✅ **Database Configuration**: Fixed PocketBase to use `--dir` flag instead of `DB_PATH` environment variable
- ✅ **Shadow DOM Interactions**: Implemented proper web component interaction patterns for all widgets

## 7. **Map Behavior Understanding** ✅

Critical insight discovered during implementation:

- **Main page (`/`)**: Shows latest **PUBLIC** location of each user (1 marker per user)
- **User page (`/u/[username]`)**: Shows latest route of the user (1 marker + track line)
- **Session page (`/u/[username]/s/[sessionname]`)**: Shows that specific session (1 marker + track line)

**Key Learning**: Sessions display 1 marker (latest position) + track line connecting all points, NOT multiple markers.

## File Structure ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Current Status Summary

**✅ Successfully Implemented:**

- **Authentication**: All 6 tests passing, JWT refresh bug fixed
- **UI Components**: All 9 tests passing, proper widget interaction
- **Session Management**: All core functionality working, API endpoints fixed
- **Location Tracking**: 4/6 tests passing, core mapping behavior working
- **Infrastructure**: Database isolation, health checks, shadow DOM handling

**⚠️ Remaining Work:**

- Session onclick handlers investigation (manual works, tests don't)
- 2 tracking test edge cases (public/private visibility, session filtering)
- Future: CI/CD integration, dedicated workflow tests

**🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed:**

- JWT signature validation in backend authentication
- API endpoint mismatches (PocketBase vs custom endpoints)
- GeoJSON format for location tracking
- Rate limiting in test environment
- Database configuration (`--dir` vs `DB_PATH`)

## Implementation Notes

- **Chrome Focus**: Targeting Chrome browser only for reliable test execution
- **Database Strategy**: Template-based database with per-test-run isolation working perfectly
- **Authentication**: Storage state management and shadow DOM interactions implemented
- **Test Data**: API-based creation with proper cleanup implemented
- **Real Bug Discovery**: E2E tests revealed and helped fix actual backend authentication bug

This implementation provides robust E2E testing infrastructure with excellent coverage of core functionality and has already proven valuable by discovering and fixing critical bugs in the application.
