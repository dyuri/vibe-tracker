1. **Upload Trigger**: User clicks "Add Photo Waypoint" or drags photo to map
2. **File Selection**: Choose photo via file picker or drag-and-drop
3. **Preview**: Show image preview with detected location (if any)
4. **Location Confirmation**: Allow manual location adjustment if needed
5. **Metadata Entry**: Enter waypoint name, type, and description
6. **Upload**: Process and create waypoint with progress indicator
7. **Confirmation**: Show success message and new waypoint on map

### Viewing Photo Waypoints

1. **Map Display**: Photo waypoints show as markers with thumbnail previews
2. **Hover Effect**: Larger thumbnail preview on hover
